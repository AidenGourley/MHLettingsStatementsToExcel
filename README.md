# MHLettingsStatementsToExcel
This project was designed to automate the process of writing income statements received from Michael Hardy Lettings, to an excel spreadsheet for easier financial visualisation and tracking.

The application is custom-built, with little interaction required from the end-user. Therefore, no GUI is required or included. 
The Excel tables may not be standard ways of representing such financial information, however the client requested the spreadsheets to be as is. 

The project is comprised of 3 parts:
- PDF scraper
- Transaction and Statement objects used to store the information from each statement in memory
- Writing the data to Microsoft Office Excel document(s).

At present, the user can expect:
- One excel spreadsheet per rental propperty.
- One page per fiscal year.
- One row per month.

There is a lot of potential to develop this software, such as including an automatic tax return calculation.
Graphs have also been suggested as an area to develop upon in the future.
